My Capstone project involves visualizing the Global infrastructure investments in Tableau.
Infrastructure is a multitrillion dollar market (according to Mc Kinsey) and it provides a cornerstone for socio-economic progress. As of  2016, investment amount to $2.5 trillion. To support global growth USD 3,7 trillion annually  is expected between 2013 and 2030. 
Goal: visualize infrastructure investment gaps, understand drivers of infrastructure investment, benchmarking countries against peers. 
I want to create a dashboard to visualize the investment amounts in each area (with latest available datasets). Dashboard should include: 
•	Different countries or divide into continents: America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Middle Eastern 
•	Year 
•	GDP  (% / $), GDP growth rate
•	Investment amount in infrastructure relative to GDP 
•	Private investment in infrastructure
•	Public- Private Partnership 
•	Global Contributions data – Development finance
